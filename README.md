 Enzyme Solutions for the Food and Beverage Industry
Enzymes are essential in numerous food and beverage production processes, enabling manufacturers to produce higher-quality products with greater consistency and efficiency. PBW offers a broad range of enzyme solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of various applications:
 1. Beverage Production:
PBW supplies enzymes for the brewing, juice, and soft drink industries. In brewing, for instance, enzymes like amylases help break down starches into fermentable sugars, enhancing the fermentation process and improving beer quality. Similarly, enzymes in juice production help extract juice more efficiently, while enzymes in soft drinks optimize sweetness and clarity. PBW’s enzyme solutions ensure that beverages are consistently high-quality, with reduced production times and lower energy consumption.
 2. Bakery Products:
Enzymes play a critical role in improving the texture, volume, and shelf life of bakery products. PBW’s enzymes for the bakery sector include alpha-amylases, lipases, and proteases, which assist in dough conditioning, fermentation, and improving overall product consistency. These enzymes help bakery manufacturers reduce production costs while enhancing the flavor and texture of products, from bread to pastries.
 3. Dairy and Cheese:
In the dairy industry, enzymes are used for milk clotting, curd formation, and whey processing. PBW offers enzymes that help optimize the production of various dairy products, including cheeses, yogurts, and dairy-based beverages. These enzymes ensure consistency in texture and flavor while also speeding up production processes, offering greater control over the final product’s characteristics.
 4. Meat and Protein Processing:
Enzymes are also valuable in meat and protein processing. PBW’s proteases break down proteins, making meat more tender and improving texture in plant-based meat alternatives. These enzymes enable manufacturers to produce high-quality meat products with improved tenderness and juiciness, while also contributing to cost savings by enhancing yield.
 5. Sugar and Starch Processing:
In sugar and starch production, PBW offers enzymes that help with the conversion of starches into glucose and other sweeteners. These enzymes facilitate efficient conversion processes, reducing the need for harsh chemicals and ensuring a more sustainable operation.
